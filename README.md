### :gear: Anaconda Python installation
This code is built up in Python. To execute Python scripts is recommended the installation of **Anaconda**. **Anaconda Python** is a free, open-source platform that allows to write and execute code in the programming language Python ([Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)). This platform simplifies package installation, managment and development, and alos comes with a large number of libraries/packages that can be you for your projects. To install **Anaconda**, just head to the [Anaconda Documentation website](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) and follow the instructions to download teh installer for your operating system.

### Anaconda Navigator
Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface that allows you to launch applications and efficiently manage conda packages, environments, and channels without using command-line commands. For more info, click [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/).

### Spyder
Spyder is a Python development environment with many features for working with Python code, such as a text editor, debugger, profiler, and interactive console. You can execute **Spyder** using the **Anaconda Navigator**. You can find Spyder Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2Dap5SfXkI&list=PLPonohdiDqg9epClEcXoAPUiK0pN5eRoc&ab_channel=SpyderIDE).

## Installation of Python packages
A **Python package** is a collection of files containing Python code (i.e., modules). To execute **IN-NGSa**, the following packages must to be installed:
- **Pydna.** Pydna is a Python package providing code for simulation of the creation of recombinant DNA molecules using molecular biology techniques. Pydna provides simulation of Primer design, PCR, Restriction digestion and so on. For more information and tutorials, click [here](https://pydna.readthedocs.io/index.html).
- **Pyteomics.** Pyteomics is a collection of lightweight and handly tools for Python taht help to handle various sorts of proteomics data (such as FASTA files). For more information and tutorials, click [here](https://pyteomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **Matlabplotlib.** Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated and interactive visualizations in Python. Fore more information and tutorials, click [here](https://matplotlib.org/).
